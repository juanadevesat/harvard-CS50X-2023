Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
    With lower number of simulations, the order of teams vary a great deal

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
    After 100.000 simulations the results vary very little and compute time increases drasticaly
